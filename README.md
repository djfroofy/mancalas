# mancalas

This is mostly for my own learnings of Clojure but I'm hoping this amounts to a
fun set of mancalas games of many varieties: Wari, Bao, Um El Gabara ... as many
as I can both find playable rules for and have time to code. The loftiest goal
here is having a game that you can play (ON A COMPUTERIZED MOBILE PHONE!!!!!)
that does none of the following:

* offers in-app purchases
* shows you ads
* makes noise
* makes music
* mentions any of my other brainfart games (or shows you ads)
* shows you the score
* shows you numbers
* gives you any control over time or space or attention


Let me know if any documentation/code (1) is incorrect with regard to rules of
specific game, historical origins, cultures associated with game etc. As a
disclaimer, my principle reference at this point is a single book sitting next
to my laptop (Russ 2000) (2).

The only UI so far this has are files in mancalas.live package - so you'll need
editor with live coding capabilities (LightTable, emacs, vim fireplace, etc) to
play. Eventually I'm aiming for simple web based interface so I might retarget
to Clojurescript or keep base game logic modules portable between Clojure and
Clojurescript.

I dunno, I have two kids and a enterprisey office job so jsut authoring this
README is pretty ambitious for me. So don't expect much here and I won't ask
you for any money. Deal?

[1] And you're all: Yeah, what documentation?
